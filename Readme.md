# This Application Works With Google Firebase 
## I Use Google Storage To Store Songs And Logo Image For Song  And Firestore To Store The Metadata For Each Song

## When you fork this application make sure to add your own Firebase services file and upload some songs to your storage in firebase 

## In Firestore make sure to name fields as what I named it in [Song] data class you will find it under [https://github.com/basselmousa/Spotify-Clone-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/bassel/myspotifyclone/data/entities/Song.kt] or if you want another field name make sure to rename it inside data class
